# LoL-Solo-Queue-Script-Dashboard
A developer API key will need to be setup for yourself to utilise the R script. You can find that here: https://developer.riotgames.com/apis

Within the R script there will need to be some alterations made. See below
token <- "Your API Key here"
gameName <- "Your LoL In-Game Name"
tagLine <- "Your LoL tagline"

Within the dashboard under the hood will be a paramater called 'Riot Id Game Name Parameter'. Change this to your LoL in-game name to change the dashboard to be focused on yourself.
